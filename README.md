# Udemy-Data-Analysis
Analyzed the Udemy Courses dataset to explore trends in course categories, pricing, enrollment, and ratings. Used Python with Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing and analysis, and created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify patterns in learner preferences and platform dynamics. 
# Udemy Courses Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves comprehensive analysis of a publicly available Udemy courses dataset to identify key trends and patterns across course categories, pricing models, enrollment, and user ratings. The objective is to extract actionable insights that can inform content strategy, marketing efforts, and user engagement on online learning platforms.

The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical summaries, and visualization of trends using Python's powerful data science ecosystem.

## Key Objectives

- Understand the distribution of courses across different categories and subcategories  
- Examine pricing trends and the prevalence of free vs. paid courses  
- Analyze enrollment patterns to identify popular courses and categories  
- Investigate relationships between course ratings and enrollment to assess quality impact  
- Visualize insights through clear, informative charts to support data-driven decisions

## Methodology

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Using descriptive statistics and group-by operations to summarize key metrics  
- **Visualization:** Employing bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize distributions and correlations  
- **Insights Extraction:** Drawing conclusions from patterns observed and summarizing actionable findings

## Technologies & Tools

- **Python:** Primary programming language for data analysis  
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and cleaning  
- **NumPy:** Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization libraries for generating plots and charts  
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive environment for coding, visualization, and documentation
